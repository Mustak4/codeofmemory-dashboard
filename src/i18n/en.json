    "whyWeStartedText3": "Technology gave us the answer. A simple QR code could bridge the physical and digital, connecting a memorial plaque to a living, breathing collection of memories. Stories that can be added to over time. Photos that bring smiles. Words that keep their spirit alive.",

    "questionCreatePage": "How do I create a memorial page?",
    "answerCreatePage": "Simply click 'Create Memorial' and follow our gentle, step-by-step guide. You'll add basic information, upload photos, and write or paste a biography. The entire process takes about 15-20 minutes, but you can save and return anytime.",
    "questionBeforePasses": "Can I create a memorial before someone passes?",
    "answerBeforePasses": "Absolutely. Many families find it healing to create a 'living memorial' where the person can share their own story, choose their photos, and record their memories while they're still with us.",
    "questionTechSavvy": "Do I need to be tech-savvy?",
    "answerTechSavvy": "Not at all. We've designed CodeOfMemory to be simple and intuitive. If you can send an email, you can create a beautiful memorial.",
    "questionQRWork": "How do QR codes work on memorial plaques?",
    "answerQRWork": "Each QR code memorial plaque includes a unique, laser-engraved QR code. When someone scans it with their smartphone camera (no app needed), they're instantly directed to the digital memorial page. The QR code never changes, so you can update the memorial page anytime while the plaque remains the same.",
    "questionMaterials": "What memorial plaque materials are available?",
    "answerMaterials": "We offer beautiful, weather-resistant memorial plaques in brushed stainless steel, bronze, brass, and black granite. Each plaque is built to last decades outdoors. The QR codes are laser-engraved directly into the material for permanent durability, ensuring your digital tribute page remains accessible for generations.",
    "questionDelivery": "How long does delivery take?",
    "answerDelivery": "UK orders typically arrive within 7-10 business days. International orders take 14-21 days. Each plaque is handcrafted with care—we never rush quality.",
    "questionUpdatePage": "Can I update the memorial page after receiving the plaque?",
    "answerUpdatePage": "Yes! The QR code always points to your memorial page. You can add photos, stories, and memories anytime—the code never changes.",
    "questionWhoCanSee": "Who can see the memorial page?",
    "answerWhoCanSee": "You control visibility. Pages can be fully public, password-protected, or private (invitation-only). You can change these settings anytime.",
    "questionData": "What happens to my data?",
    "answerData": "Your memorial data is stored securely and encrypted. We never sell or share your information. Memorial pages are preserved permanently—they won't disappear if you stop paying.",
    "questionDelete": "Can I delete a memorial?",
    "answerDelete": "Yes, you have full control. You can delete or archive a memorial at any time from your account settings.",
    "questionCost": "How much does a memorial plaque cost?",
    "answerCost": "Plaques start at £79 for stainless steel and £129 for bronze. This includes the memorial page setup, QR code, and lifetime hosting. No subscription fees.",
    "questionMonthlyFee": "Is there a monthly fee?",
    "answerMonthlyFee": "No. Once you order a plaque, your memorial page is hosted forever at no additional cost. Optional premium features (like custom domains) are available but never required.",
    "questionDigitalOnly": "Can I order just a digital memorial without a plaque?",
    "answerDigitalOnly": "Yes. Digital-only memorials are free to create. You'll get a shareable link instead of a QR code plaque.",
    "questionFamilyAdd": "Can family and friends add to the memorial?",
    "answerFamilyAdd": "Yes! You can invite others to contribute photos and memories. You approve each addition before it appears on the page.",
    "questionPhotoLimit": "Is there a limit to how many photos I can add?",
    "answerPhotoLimit": "No photo limits. Add as many as you'd like—your memorial grows over time.",
    "questionVideos": "Can I include videos?",
    "answerVideos": "Yes. You can embed videos from YouTube, Vimeo, or upload directly (premium feature).",
